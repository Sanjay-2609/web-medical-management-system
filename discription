The undertaking is called a “Virtual Medicine Home.” By using this application, patients can reserve online meetings with their preferred specialists. Specialists can recommend medical services, e-remedy, and consider the patient’s clinical records, lab reports, and many more. The app also lets users explore and interface with individuals who are donating their organs or blood. During the times of the pandemic, when it gets dangerous to visit the hospital, this JAVA project comes to your rescue. The application comes with two modules — an Admin and a Doctor module. The Admin module is responsible for the online programming framework, and the Doctor module allows specialists to communicate with patients.
